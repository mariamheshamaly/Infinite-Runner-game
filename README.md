# Infinite-Runner-game
This is a simple Infinite Runner game, similar to Subway Surfers.

2- Gameplay Overview
The player controls a sphere that moves forward automatically on an infinite floor. The
floor is divided into three lanes. The player needs to dodge obstacles while managing
both ability and health points in order to avoid dying. The player encounters Collectibles: that can be found along the road and collecting them increases the player’s
resources; and Obstacles: that can be found along the road and touching them decreases
the player’s health points. The player’s goal
is to achieve the highest score possible before losing all their health points.

3- Game Items
During gameplay, the player encounters different collectibles, and obstacles. Interacting
with each, affects the player differently. Below, we will discuss collectibles and obstacles
available and the expected outcome when the player interacts with them.

3.1 Collectibles
We have two types of collectibles that increase the player’s resources upon collection.
Collectibles are removed from play upon collection.
The collectibles are as follows:
• Red Health Orbs: Increases Health Points by 1.
• Yellow Ability Orbs: Increases Ability Points by 1.

3.2 Obstacles
We have three different obstacles depending on how many lanes these obstacles block (e.g
3 different length-ed cuboids). The player’s health points are affected if they run into
the obstacles. However, avoiding obstacles by jumping over them increases score points.
Dodging obstacles by steering left/right rewards no score. Obstacles are removed from
play when hit or when the player successfully jumps over them. All Obstacles should have
a colored material on them.
Each obstacle type is described in depth below:
 1 Lane Obstacle Decreases Health Points by 3 points Upon Hitting, Increases Score by 3 by Jumping Over
 2 Lane Obstacle Decreases Health Points by 2 points Upon Hitting, Increases Score by 2 by Jumping Over
 3 Lane Obstacle Decreases Health Points by 1 point Upon Hitting, Increases Score by 1 by Jumping Over
